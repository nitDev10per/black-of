## 🚀 Live Demo

[🔗 Click to view deployed site](https://black-of.vercel.app/)

## 📂 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (React Framework)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Material-UI (MUI)**
- **Vercel** for deployment

## 📁 Project Setup

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitDev10per/black-of.git

🧱 Component Architecture
The project uses a modular and reusable component structure. Each UI element (e.g., card, navbar, video container) is split into its own component to keep code maintainable and scalable.

📱 Responsive Design Strategy
Implemented fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

Tested across mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screen sizes.

Layouts adjust gracefully with respect to screen width and height.

🖼️ Performance Optimizations
Lazy Loading of Images: Images load only when needed.

Dynamic Video Loading: Video modules load dynamically only on hover.

Once loaded, the video remains mounted unless the page is refreshed, optimizing resource usage.

Code Splitting and Next.js image optimization used.

♿ Accessibility
Semantic HTML tags used (<nav>, <main>, etc.)

Accessible keyboard navigation

ARIA roles added where necessary

Color contrast and focus states considered

✨ Animations
Matched animations as per the Figma design

Used MUI and CSS transitions for smooth user experience

Animation on hover and page transitions

🧪 Testing (Planned)
Basic testing will be added for key components using Jest and React Testing Library

Improvements will be made based on test results or bugs reported

🔍 Challenges Faced
Reproducing pixel-perfect and same-to-same animation as in Figma was challenging but successfully implemented

Managing video import dynamically only on hover while maintaining performance was tricky, but it works efficiently now

📈 Future Improvements
Add full test coverage for all UI components

Implement additional performance profiling

Add CMS integration or admin panel for content update (optional)

📄 Additional Notes
This project is built under 24-hour deadline on 24th May as part of a Frontend Developer assessment task

Fully completed and deployed with functional responsiveness and design accuracy

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
